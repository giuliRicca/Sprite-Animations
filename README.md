# Sprite-Animations

Hello World! I'm Giuliano Ricca, a 14 years old boy that like programming and learning and this is my project of animation for a character in a game. I made this in python 3 using the module Pygame and I only did the walking animation for now but I'll be posting a jumping too and I do this so people can see my code and help me improve and learn more. And maybe this will be usefull for someone looking for something like this.
